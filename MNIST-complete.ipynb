    "* **Goal**: We want to create a *deep learning model* that can correctly classify images of *hand-written digits*\n",
    "  * The model should be able to classify each of the 10 digits, based on small gray-scale images\n",
    "  * *Classifying* means returning the displayed digit as an integer between 0 and 9\n",
    "* **Examples**:<br>![digits](pics/digits.png)\n",
    "* **Challenges**:\n",
    "  * Assuming a size of $28\\times 28$ pixels and 8-bit color resolution, there are $256^{28\\cdot 28}$ different images\n",
    "  * It is difficult to design hand-crafted rules for classifying images, given the amount of variation inherent to handwritings\n",
    "    * Possibilities: average intensity, topological analysis (number of \"holes\"), etc.\n",
    "* **Methods**:\n",
    "  * We will use (a subset of) the famous [MNIST dataset](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MNIST_database) for training and evaluating our model\n",
    "    * Contains 42,000 gray-scale images of size $28\\times 28$ pixels\n",
    "    * Each image is *labelled* with the true digit, i.e., we know which digit is displayed $\\rightarrow$ needed for training and evaluating the model\n",
    "  * We will employ [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) as our deep learning framework\n",
    "    * One of the most popular deep learning frameworks\n",
    "    * Widely-used, especially in academia\n",
    "    * Prominent alternative: [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/learn)\n",
    "  * Although digit classification is a comparatively easy problem where even simple models achieve high accuracy, we will investigate ways to further improve accuracy"
